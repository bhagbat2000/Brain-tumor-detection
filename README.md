# Brain-tumor-detection

it is a project where you can train your model by your own and also get desire output<br>
First you go through the pdf where you understand about Kmeans algorithim ad what this project is all about<br>
Here i have given two datasets of images named as train and test you can use that for your execution proupose<br>
I have given a code for model where you train a model on the basis of one image. I have like this to have a simple project,you can go for any other model as you wish<br>
Here i have also given two code related to brain tumour detection one for single photo and other for a dataset of photos<br>
i multiple photos all you need to do wait a for a another pop up of gui all else close the current prediction gui<br>
you can also check screenshot for my training and testing
